# Discord Homepage Clone

[Live](https://witktom5.github.io/discord-website-clone/)

## Overview

It's just a clone of the Discord homepage (frontend) I made in pure HTML and CSS. Assets come from the original homepage. I used free fonts from Google Fonts. I think it looks pretty close, though things like colors might be a little bit off (I tried guessing them instead of checking in devtools). It is just as responsive as the original.
